# Tech Survey Analytics: Visualizing Programming Trends, Demographics, and Technology Preferences

## Project Objective:
The "Tech Survey Analytics" capstone project aims to analyze patterns and trends in technology jobs to comprehend current and future job demands in the technology field. It seeks to identify the leading programming languages and databases in high demand and evaluate the popularity of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Additionally, the project will explore demographics and gender disparities in the technology job market, providing valuable insights for individuals aspiring to pursue careers in the technical field and professionals working in IT departments.

## Data Sources:
The project will utilize data from the Stack Overflow Developer 2019 Survey and GitHub Job Postings to gather insights into programming language preferences, technology usage patterns, and job demands in the technology industry.

## Project Phases:

## Data Exploration :
Explore the collected data to understand its structure, variables, and potential insights it can offer.
## Data Cleaning: 
Remove any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers to ensure the data is of high quality for analysis.
## Data Visualization: 
Use visualization tools and libraries to create insightful charts and graphs that showcase trends, patterns, and comparisons in the data.
## Presentation:
Summarize and present the findings through three dashboards, each with specific tabs for a comprehensive overview of technology usage, future trends, and demographics.
Dashboards and Descriptions:

## Current Technology Usage Dashboard:

Panel 1: Visualize the Top 10 LanguageWorkedWith as a Bar chart to identify the most popular programming languages used by developers. Include value labels for precise details.
Panel 2: Capture the Top 10 DatabaseWorkedWith as a Column chart to showcase the most sought-after databases in the industry. Use value labels for clarity.
Panel 3: Display PlatformWorkedWith as a Word cloud chart to provide an overview of the variety of platforms used by survey respondents.
Panel 4: Represent the Top 10 WebFrameWorkedWith as a Hierarchy bubble chart to highlight popular web frameworks among developers.

## Future Technology Trend Dashboard:

Panel 1: Visualize the Top 10 LanguageDesireNextYear as a Bar chart to reveal the programming languages developers want to work with in the future. Include value labels for specific counts.
Panel 2: Capture the Top 10 DatabaseDesireNextYear as a Column chart to showcase databases desired by developers for future work. Utilize value labels for clarity.
Panel 3: Display PlatformDesireNextYear as a Tree map chart to present the desired platforms to work with in the future. Utilize area hierarchy and color fields for insights.
Panel 4: Represent the Top 10 WebFrameDesireNextYear as a Hierarchy bubble chart to highlight desired web frameworks for developers' future endeavors.

## Demographics Dashboard:

Panel 1: Use Filters for this tab feature to filter out entries of other genders except "Man" and "Woman." Capture Respondent classified by Gender as a Pie chart to show the gender distribution of survey respondents. Include percentage labels for precision.
Panel 2: Capture Respondent Count for Countries as a Map chart to visualize the geographic distribution of survey respondents. Use region-location color fields for distinction.
Panel 3: Capture Respondent Count by Age as a Line chart to represent the age distribution of survey participants. Include value labels and markers for specific points.
Panel 4: Capture Respondent Count by Gender, classified by Formal Education Level, as a Stacked bar chart to illustrate education distribution across genders among survey respondents. Utilize value labels for clarity.

## Conclusion:
Through the "Tech Survey Analytics" project, we aim to provide valuable insights into technology trends, job demands, and demographic dynamics within the technology industry. By presenting these visualizations and analyses, we aim to equip aspiring individuals and professionals in the technical field with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions about their careers and adapt to the ever-evolving technology landscape.
